			      <p>Learning code, I never liked tests. Why? Because the process went like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write code that works (by manually looking at the results).</li>
<li>Write tests to satisfy professors/people that wanted to see tests.</li>
</ol>

<p>My initial naive thought was: &ldquo;Why write more code? These tests aren&rsquo;t useful, I&rsquo;ve already written the code I need, and it works.&rdquo; Those were dark days, my friend. Then a highly recommended book came my way, Practical Object-oriented Design In Ruby, that showed me code <em>changes</em> a lot. Like, a lot. Without tests, you&rsquo;ll need to manually look at <em>everything</em> whenever you make a change, to ensure nothing got broken. My process then became this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write code that works (by manually looking at the results).</li>
<li>Write tests on everything, to prove that it works without needing manual inspection.</li>
<li>Change the code a little bit.</li>
<li>Flip the table because half the tests are now broken (but the code is correct).</li>
</ol>

<p>After reading the aforementioned textbook a bit more, I realised why I was having such an awful time. I wasn&rsquo;t just testing for the expected output, I was also testing the implementation. I demanded the specific &ldquo;what&rdquo;, and I demanded the specific &ldquo;how&rdquo; as well.</p>

<p>If you, reader, have a sinking feeling that this is you too, then listen closely. Every object should have a public interface (how others talk to it), and a private implementation (how it figures out how to give others what they want). The public methods are the menu at a restaurant. The private methods are the kitchen out back.</p>

<p>With this in mind, consider the following question: If you ask for an item from the menu, does it matter <em>how</em> that item is prepared? Did they use a spatula or a spoon? Was the stove on medium heat or high? As long as you get your food, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what specific method they used. With this break through my process is now this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write code that works (by manually looking at the results).</li>
<li>Write tests for the interfaces between objects (checking the output of public methods).</li>
<li>Change the code a little bit (different setup in the kitchen).</li>
<li>Run tests to ensure the right food is still being served.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now I can make a change to the inner workings of my code, run my test suite, and know that the program still works. My tests don&rsquo;t trip me up, because I&rsquo;m not enforcing the &ldquo;how&rdquo;, only the resulting &ldquo;what&rdquo;.</p>
